Manipulating WebSocket messages to exploit vulnerabilities

Welcome to websockets! If you're having issues, the message that must be modified is the first one.
Should look like this:

{"message":"<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>"}

When you forward it, the next one should look like this:

{"user":"You","content":"<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>"}

That's it. If you want to have some fun, you can sneak it that payload in a lot of places, including in the replies the bot gives you.
