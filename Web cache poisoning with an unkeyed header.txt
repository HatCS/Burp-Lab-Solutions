Web cache poisoning with an unkeyed header

The solution provided is great and very detailed. Here's how the request should look like:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: ac691f6e1f6682d4800d5f9e00610089.web-security-academy.net
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:76.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/76.0

Connection: close

In my case, I clicked on view exploit and send the request which prompted the lab complete banner. You might have to send the request a few times.
