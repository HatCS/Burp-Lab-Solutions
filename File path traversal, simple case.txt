File path traversal, simple case

Click on a blog then open the image in a new tab. Send that corresponding request to Repeater in Burp.
Now try changing the filename with /etc/passwd. You'll get an error. Start iterating by adding /.. in front. After 3 of them you'll get the contents of /etc/passwd.
Do it in repeater as in a browser the image will error out.

Final request:
GET /image?filename=/../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
