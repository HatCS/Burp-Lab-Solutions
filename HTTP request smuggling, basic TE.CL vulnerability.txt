HTTP request smuggling, basic TE.CL vulnerability

Start by disabling the autoupdate content length in Repeater (in the topmost row)
Now launch a smuggle probe on the main page (If the option doesn't show up, download the HTTP Smuggler from the BApp store).
Wait a bit for the requests to populate - reminder that they'll be in the Target tab.
Send the request to Repeater, it should look like this:

The request has a content lenght of 4, so let's see if we can add more stuff after it.
