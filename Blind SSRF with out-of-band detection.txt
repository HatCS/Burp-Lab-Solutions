Blind SSRF with out-of-band detection

Fairly simple once you figure out the trick. The out of band attack occurs in the Referer header.
In order to test for it, fire up Burp Collaborator, and click on a random product. Send the request to repeater.
Now replace the Referer header content with your collaborator URL.
