File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped non-recursively

Solution porvided is great.

Same issue of xss in file path. Replace the filename with your desired path, but wtih longer spaces this time:
https://ace91f601f824232803892650003008b.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=....//....//....//etc/passwd

Request:

You can use a tool such as kadimus to look for LFIs. Unfortunately it wouldn't find this one, but I forked the project and added it:
