User ID controlled by request parameter 

Fairly simple. Log in to the provided account, go to your account and see that the URL contains a parameter called id:
https://accc1f471fd08ed7801a3317008c00d6.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=wiener

Adjust the id to carlos
https://accc1f471fd08ed7801a3317008c00d6.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=carlos

Submit the key and there you go.
