Information disclosure in version control history

The solution provided didn't really work for me. Running git diff in the main tree outputs this:

diff --git a/admin.conf b/admin.conf
deleted file mode 100644
index 21d23f1..0000000
--- a/admin.conf
+++ /dev/null
@@ -1 +0,0 @@
-ADMIN_PASSWORD=env('ADMIN_PASSWORD')

Which only show that a line has been removed. 

Instead I ran a git log command in the main directory
$ git log

error: unable to open object pack directory: .git/objects/pack: Not a directory

    Remove admin password from config

commit b3ab868623ac397e780ff2df1fc93ad5a651e3b9
Author: Carlos Montoya <carlos@evil-user.net>

    Add skeleton admin panel


So let's just switch to the commit before Carlos removed the admin password:

git checkout b3ab868623ac397e780ff2df1fc93ad5a651e3b9


Now the admin.conf file should be in the main directory. Just read it to find the password.
