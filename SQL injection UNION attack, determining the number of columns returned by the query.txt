SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query

Solution provided works great. We're trying to find out the number of columns by asking for more columns until the server stop erroring out:
Turns out we have 3 columns since we required 3 NULL's, which you probably could've told by looking at the database results anyway.

Payload:
'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL--
