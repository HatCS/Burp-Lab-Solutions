SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft

It's easier to do this in Burp repeater, but let's do in a browser.

Let's identify the number of columns. Based on the cheatsheet, a mysql database has "-- " as a comment. Note the space. We'll translate it to %20 in our URL:

'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--%20

Finding text columns:

'+UNION+SELECT+'asdf','asdf'--%20

Once again, by checking the cheatsheet, we can get the version.

'+UNION+SELECT+@@version,'asdf'--%20

Lab complete.
