DOM XSS in AngularJS expression with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded

DOM and AngularJS, fun!

This requires some prerequisite knowledge about how AngularJS works, and it is mentioned in the lab description, AngularJS scans the content of HTML nodes that contain the ng-app attributes. Within those attributes, you can execute JS code within double curly braces to bypass encoding.

Searching for a random string and looking at the page source, we can spot the ng-app attribute in the body:

<body ng-app>
    <div theme="blog">
        <script src="/resources/js/labHeader.js"></script>
        <div id="labHeader">
        (...)

and the search string as part of this body

<section class="blog-header">
    <h1>0 search results for 'asdf'</h1>
    <hr>
</section>

Looking up AngularJS's syntax, an expression would look like this:

{{ $on.constructor('alert(1337)')() }}

Input that in the search string and the XSS should be triggered and the lab complete
